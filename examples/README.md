## ðŸ“‚ contents

- **`example_notebook.ipynb`** â†’ interactive Jupyter notebook demonstrating:  

  1. loading a portfolio (`sample_portfolio.csv`)

  2. calculating core risk metrics (VaR, CVaR, volatility)

  3. generating a likelihood Ã— impact **risk matrix**

  4. running simple stress tests

  5. visualizing results with plots  

- **`README.md`** â†’ this guide

## quick start

1. open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code: 

```bash

jupyter notebook examples/example_notebook.ipynb
```

2. follow the cells step by step to explore RiskLab's features

3. swap in your own portfolio by changing the path in the first cell

## the workflow

portfolio --> risk metrics --> risk matrix --> visualization --> dashboard

this notebook serves as a full end to end demo so you can experiment with metrics, visualizations and risk scenarios without touching the core code
